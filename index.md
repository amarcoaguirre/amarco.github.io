# Welcome to My Home Lab  

Exploring, experimenting, and constantly improving my home lab setup.  
This site is a **snapshot of the journey**, what I’ve built so far, the tools I’m using, and the plans I have for expanding it in the future.

## 🖥️ What You'll Find Here  
- **Media Server & Proxmox** → Automated Plex libraries, Dockerized Servarr stack, VPN integration.  
- **Network Architecture** → VLAN segmentation, firewall rules, UniFi-powered infrastructure.  
- **Windows Server & Azure Labs** → Active Directory, Intune, Azure AD, and security experiments.
